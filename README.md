# Browser Screenshots in OSX

Some basic scripts that open a list of URL's in a web browser and take a screenshot. There's lots of room for improvements with them, but it works. Feedback is welcome.

The scripts use a handy utility called GetWindowID https://github.com/smokris/GetWindowID
You can compile yourself if you prefer.
